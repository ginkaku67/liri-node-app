Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface
Overview
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data (in theory).
Intended Interactions
This application can help you search through Spotify, OMBD, and the Bands in Town application.
Where it is currently:
I am currently having trouble determining what information should be in what file to perform the ajax calls to complete each task. I simply do not know how much of this process should take place in the LIRI file, and seeing as I cannot perform a search, I am clearly missing something important.
